    "All geospatial vector data can be described by a combining a set of fundamental\n",
    "geometric objects: **points**, **lines**, and **polygons** are the basic\n",
    "ingredients of working with spatial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the library package [shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/) has\n",
    "become the standard tool for working with geo-spatial objects, and for carruing\n",
    "out a range of geometric operations. A basic understanding of how *shapely*\n",
    "works is paramount for using higher-level tools, such as, for instance,\n",
    "[geopandas](https://geopandas.pydata.org/) (see [lesson 2](../lesson-2/overview))\n",
    "that handles entire data sets of geographic information (a.k.a. ‘layers’).\n",

    "\n",
    "Shapely, like the vast majority of geospatial software, follows the data model\n",
    "set forward in the [Open Geospatial Consortium’s *Simple Feature Access*\n",

    "terminology used by *shapely*, but the general concepts are applicable much more\n",
    "widely.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Geometric objects are described and constructed by *coordinate tuples*\n",
    "\n",
    "Even more fundamental than that, **coordinate tuples** are what is used to\n",
    "define the geometric fundamentals point, line, and polygon. Coordinate tuples\n",
    "typically are either two-dimensional `(x, y)`, or three-dimensional `(x, y, z)`.\n",

    ":class: info\n",
    "\n",
    "A [tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tuples-and-sequences)\n",
    "is a Python data structure that consists of a number of values separated by\n",
    "commas. Coordinate pairs are often represented as a tuple. For example,\n",
    "`(60.192059, 24.945831)` is a tuple with two values, `(1,)` a tuple with one\n",
    "value (note the comma that distinguishes a one-value tuple from a mathematical\n",
    "expression in parentheses), and `tuple([1, 2, 3])` converts (‘casts’) a `list`\n",
    "into a `tuple`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples belong to the [sequence data\n",
    "types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq) in Python.\n",
    "Other sequence data types are lists and ranges. Tuples have many similarities\n",
    "with lists and ranges, but they are often used for different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are\n",
    "[immutable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-immutable), which means\n",
    "that the contents of a tuple cannot be altered (while lists are mutable; you\n",
    "can, for example, add and remove values from lists).\n",
    "\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### Points\n",
    "\n",
    "**Point** geometries represent a singular point (in two- or three-dimensional\n",
    "Euclidean space). Points are defined by a single coordinate tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LineStrings\n",
    "\n",
    "**LineString** geometries (and the related **LinearRing**s) represent lines.\n",
    "They are defined by a sequence of points. By connecting the points in order,\n",
    "a line is formed, if the first and last point are the same, a linear ring.\n",
    "Consequently, to describe a *LineString*, at least two points are necessary, \n",
    "for a *LinearRing* at least three (first and last being identical).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polygons\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, **Polygon** geometries represent an area. A polygon is defined by\n",
    "exactly one *LinearRing* as its circumference, and any number of additional\n",
    "*LinearRing*s representing holes that are cut out. As such, at minimum, three\n",
    "coordinate tuples are needed to define a Polygon (but it becomes more difficult\n",
    "quickly, as, naturally, the coordinates that define the holes have to lie within\n",
    "the exterior *LinearRing*, and also must not intersect each other).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collections of geometric objects\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the fundamental geometric types can be combined to represent more complex\n",
    "geographic features, such as, for instance, administrative areas that consist of\n",
    "multiple discontinuous regions:\n",

    "## Using shapely to create, access, manipulate and analyse geometric objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Shapely can perform many useful operations on geometries, and provides a range\n",
    "of attributes of geometries. For instance, you can:\n",
    "- create lines and polygons from a set of points\n",
    "- calculate the area, length, perimeter, etc., of geometries\n",
    "- perform geometric operations on a set of geometries, for instance, merging\n",
    "  (`union`), subtracting (`difference`), or calculating the distance between\n",
    "  geometries.\n",
    "- query the relationship between geometries, i.e., find out whether two\n",
    "  geometries intersect, touch, cross, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating `Point` geometries and accessing their properties\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a point geometry object is easy: simply pass coordinates (x, y, and\n",
    "possibly z) to its [constructor](https://pythonbasics.org/constructor/)."
